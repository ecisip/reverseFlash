# reverseFlash

* A quick and basic project for reviewing.
* Basically just flashcards (the "reverse" part used to be relevant, but not now).
* Run it like a normal html+js+css project. I personally use Xampp for that.
* Designed for one sitting review, that is, it doesn't save anything.
* There's nothing special in this project tbh. Just something I did as pasttime.

POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS (if any, lol):
* "Enumerator mode". Basically a review for enumerable stuffs. Picture a flashcard saying "enumerate the 3 primary colors" for example.
* Saving a group of flashcards??? Imma learn database first.
